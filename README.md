# Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux (Egghead.io)

This repo contains notes from [Dan Abramov's](https://github.com/gaearon) second [Redux course](https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux) on Egghead.io.

## 01\. Simplifying the Arrow Functions
See how ES6 features can be used to clean up arrow functions even more. [Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-simplifying-the-arrow-functions)


## 02. Supplying the Initial State
We will learn how to start a Redux app with a previously persisted state, and how it merges with the initial state specified by the reducers. [Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-supplying-the-initial-state)


## 03. Persisting the State to the Local Storage
We will learn how to use store.subscribe() to efficiently persist some of the appâ€™s state to localStorage and restore it after a refresh. [Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-persisting-the-state-to-the-local-storage#/tab-transcript)


## 04. Refactoring the Entry Point
We will learn how to better separate the code in the entry point to prepare it for adding the router.

## 05. Adding React Router to the project
We will learn how to add React Router to a Redux project and make it render our root component. [Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-adding-react-router-to-the-project?series=building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux#/tab-transcript)


## 06. Navigating with React Router `<Link>`
We will learn how to change the address bar using a component from React Router.

## 07. Filtering Redux State with React Router Params
We will learn how adding React Router shifts the balance of responsibilities, and how the components can use both at the same time.

## 08. Using withRouter() to Inject the Params into Connected Components
We will learn how to use withRouter() to inject params provided by React Router into connected components deep in the tree without passing them down all the way down as props.
