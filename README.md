# Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux (Egghead.io)

This repo contains notes from [Dan Abramov's](https://github.com/gaearon) second [Redux course](https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux) on Egghead.io.

## 01\. [Simplifying the Arrow Functions](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-simplifying-the-arrow-functions)

See how ES6 features can be used to clean up arrow functions even more.

## 02. [Supplying the Initial State](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-supplying-the-initial-state)

We will learn how to start a Redux app with a previously persisted state, and how it merges with the initial state specified by the reducers.
