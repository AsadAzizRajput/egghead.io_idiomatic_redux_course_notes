# Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux (Egghead.io)

This repo contains notes from [Dan Abramov's](https://github.com/gaearon) second [Redux course](https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux) on Egghead.io.

## 01\. Simplifying the Arrow Functions
See how ES6 features can be used to clean up arrow functions even more. [Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-simplifying-the-arrow-functions)


## 02. Supplying the Initial State
We will learn how to start a Redux app with a previously persisted state, and how it merges with the initial state specified by the reducers. [Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-supplying-the-initial-state)


## 03. Persisting the State to the Local Storage
We will learn how to use store.subscribe() to efficiently persist some of the appâ€™s state to localStorage and restore it after a refresh. [Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-persisting-the-state-to-the-local-storage#/tab-transcript)


## 04. Refactoring the Entry Point
We will learn how to better separate the code in the entry point to prepare it for adding the router.
